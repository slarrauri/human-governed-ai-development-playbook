## Solo Developer / Vibe Coding Implementation

### Quick Start Configuration

**Minimal `.sdc/config.yaml`**:
```yaml
project:
  name: "my-project"
  type: "web-application" 
  language: "javascript"
  framework: "vanilla"

structure:
  source_dir: "src"
  
commands:
  dev: "npm run dev"
  test: "npm test"

governance:
  checkpoints:
    after_analysis: false
    after_design: false 
    after_implementation: false
    after_testing: false
    before_pr: false  # No PR needed for solo work
```

### Streamlined Workflow

#### 1. Express Mode (Fastest)
```bash
# One command to go from idea to implementation
sdc express "Add user authentication with GitHub OAuth"

# Result: Complete feature implemented, tested, and ready to use
```

#### 2. Interactive Mode (Learning-Friendly)
```bash
# Step-by-step with minimal checkpoints
sdc create feature "User profile management"

# AI guides you through each phase with quick approvals
```

#### 3. Documentation Mode (Portfolio Projects)
```bash
# Generate comprehensive documentation for showcase
sdc create feature "Data visualization dashboard" --document-all

# Result: Feature + complete documentation for portfolio/resume
```

### Solo Developer Benefits

### Example: Solo Web App Development

**Project**: Personal expense tracking app
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Technology**: React + Node.js

```yaml
# .sdc/config.yaml
project:
  name: "expense-tracker"
  type: "web-application"
  language: "javascript"
  framework: "react"

technology:
  runtime: "node"
  package_manager: "npm"
  testing:
    unit: "jest"
    e2e: "none"  # Skip e2e for rapid development

commands:
  dev: "npm run dev"
  build: "npm run build"

## Scaling Best Practices

### Configuration Evolution

#### Start Simple, Scale Gradually
```yaml
# Phase 1: Minimal viable configuration
governance:
  checkpoints:
    before_pr: true

# Phase 2: Add quality gates
governance:
  checkpoints:
    after_design: true
    before_pr: true

# Phase 3: Full enterprise governance
governance:
  checkpoints:
    after_analysis: true
    after_design: true
    after_testing: true
    before_pr: true
    before_deployment: true
```

#### Team Maturity Alignment
- **New Teams**: More checkpoints, guidance, and review
- **Experienced Teams**: Streamlined process, automated approvals
- **Expert Teams**: Minimal oversight, trusted autonomous operation

### Common Scaling Patterns

#### 1. Checkpoint Graduation
Teams earn fewer checkpoints as they demonstrate competency:
```yaml
team_maturity:
  junior: ["after_analysis", "after_design", "after_testing", "before_pr"]
  intermediate: ["after_design", "before_pr"]
  senior: ["before_pr"]
  expert: []  # Full autonomy
```

#### 2. Approval Delegation
Delegate approvals to appropriate team levels:
```yaml
approval_delegation:
  feature_changes: "tech-lead"
  architectural_changes: "architect"
  breaking_changes: "senior-architect"
  compliance_changes: "compliance-officer"
```

#### 3. Metrics-Driven Scaling
Use metrics to optimize process efficiency:
```yaml
scaling_metrics:
  velocity: "features_per_sprint"
  quality: "defect_rate"
  satisfaction: "team_happiness"
  
optimization_triggers:
  high_velocity_low_defects: "reduce_checkpoints"
  low_velocity_high_defects: "increase_governance"
```
