# AI Development Risks & Limitations — Mitigation Strategies

This document outlines the known challenges and potential drawbacks of the **Human Governed AI Development Playbook** methodology. Understanding these risks is critical to ensuring its responsible, scalable, and maintainable implementation.

---

## 1. Context Dependency

* **Risk**: If the initial prompt is vague or lacks context, the pipeline produces incorrect or incomplete solutions.
* **Impact**: Wasted compute, incorrect PRs, poor experience.
* **Mitigation**: Strengthen the `PROMPT_REFINE` agent with iterative clarification and explicit task confirmation.

---

## 2. Correction Loops

* **Risk**: If the human feedback is vague, the `RETRY_AGENT` may regenerate similar (or worse) outputs.
* **Mitigation**: Enforce structured feedback collection before retrying. Use contextual diffing to guide correction.

---

## 3. Overhead for Small Tasks

* **Risk**: Full Human Governed AI Development Playbook execution may be overkill for minor edits (e.g., renaming a label).
* **Mitigation**: Introduce a `quick_task_mode` that bypasses full agent workflow for trivial tasks.

---

## 4. Infrastructure Complexity

* **Risk**: The system depends on multiple services: Git, Sourcegraph, Weaviate, test runners, etc.
* **Mitigation**: Use container orchestration (Docker Compose, Kubernetes), and provide local runner scripts.

---

## 5. LLM Limitations

* **Risk**: Agents may use deprecated APIs, outdated packages, or produce logic bugs.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Maintenance Agent runs `pub outdated`, `dart analyze`, and `flutter test`.
  * Internal Reviewer Agent evaluates style, correctness, and stability.

---

## 6. Dependency Conflicts

* **Risk**: Tasks in parallel may change the same dependency/module.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Use task-isolated branches
  * Require rebase or sync before PR
  * Lock dependencies via `pubspec.lock`

---

## 7. Human Governance Failure

* **Risk**: If the human blindly approves PRs, quality and control are lost.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Require test + lint summary before approval
  * Provide review checklists for humans

---

## 8. Resource Consumption

* **Risk**: Parallel agents can cause high CPU/memory/disk usage.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Limit concurrent task runners
  * Prioritize critical tasks
  * Use pooled or stateless agents when possible

---

## 9. Lack of Architectural Alignment

* **Risk**: Many small automated tasks may produce incoherent or fragmented system structure.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Periodic human-led architectural reviews
  * Agent-level pattern detection (e.g. duplicated services or UI flows)

Human Governed AI Development Playbook is a powerful and scalable methodology, but not without trade-offs. By acknowledging and addressing these risks, teams can achieve fast, high-quality, and governance-compliant automation — while keeping humans in the loop where it matters most.
