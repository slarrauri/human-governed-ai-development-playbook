# SlackDevs Manifesto

> Taming Artificial Intelligence

---

## Our Mission

Transform the relationship between developers and artificial intelligence:
We don’t want AI to replace humans.
We want humans to enhance their experience, creativity, and knowledge by using AI as a conscious, ethical, and powerful tool.

---

## Our Principles

### 1. **AI Developer Experience First (AIDX)**

AI should improve the developer’s life—not complicate it.
We aim for workflows that are natural, predictable, fast, and focused.

### 2. **AI Software Design (AISD)**

We design software with the idea that AI is part of its lifecycle:
From analysis to design, generation, and maintenance.

### 3. **Knowledge First**

There’s no real growth without documentation, organization, and effective information retrieval.
SlackDevs turns data chaos into structured, actionable knowledge.

### 4. **Open Source & Community**

SlackDevs is built on collaboration, respect for Open Source, and the spirit of sharing to evolve.
We believe in the power of collective intelligence.

### 5. **Simplicity and Modularity**

SlackDevs is extensible, customizable, and evolutionary.
Each module should stand alone—and also thrive in synergy.

### 6. **Transparency and Ethics**

Every human-AI interaction must be traceable, controllable, and reversible.
AI doesn’t decide on its own.
Humans always have the final say.

### 7. **Resilience**

SlackDevs is designed to fail, recover, and learn.
We design for change, for evolution, for the unexpected.

## Our Vision

A future where human intelligence, augmented by AI,
is not only more productive,
but also more creative, more thoughtful, more powerful.

A world where building software is more than writing lines of code—
it’s about crafting living, flexible, intelligent ideas.

SlackDevs is the first step to make that future not just possible,
but inevitable.

## Our Commitment

* Build open, ethical, and human-centered platforms.
* Respect the work of developers.
* Continuously improve the creation experience.
* Share our progress to empower others.
* Stay true to the principle that guides us:

> "Tame AI to unleash true human power."
