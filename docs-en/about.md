# About SlackDevs

## Our Motivation

Modern software development is increasingly complex, distributed, and overloaded with repetitive tasks. While AI models are powerful, they often lack structure, consistency, and accountability.

**SlackDevs** was born to solve this: a modular, agent-driven methodology that empowers autonomous software development — without losing human control.

We believe that automation shouldn't replace developers, but **multiply their capabilities**. SlackDevs helps teams scale safely by combining AI autonomy with **human governance checkpoints** at critical stages.

## Core Principles

1. **Human in the loop, always** — AI executes, but humans govern and validate.
2. **Agent specialization** — Each Human Governed AI Development Playbook phase has its own focused AI agent.
3. **Branch isolation** — Tasks run in isolated Git branches to ensure traceability.
4. **Open source & transparent** — Anyone can use, audit, or extend the methodology.
5. **Tool-agnostic** — Works across languages, frameworks, and deployment environments.
