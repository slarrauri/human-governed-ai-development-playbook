# Human Governed AI Development Playbook — Overview

The **Human Governed AI Development Playbook** is a structured, agent-driven methodology that integrates specialized AI agents into each phase of the software development lifecycle, while ensuring human oversight and control at defined checkpoints. This approach enables teams to scale AI-driven development with transparency, traceability, and quality.


## Core principles:
- **Full-cycle AI automation** with human governance checkpoints at key phases.
- **Modular task execution** across defined SDLC stages.
- **Isolated Git branches** for safe, traceable task workflows.
- **Rigorous quality gates** for requirements, design, implementation, testing, security, performance, and deployment.
- **Scalable workflows** suitable for solo developers up to large enterprise teams.


## Phases in the Playbook:
1. AI Prompt Refinement
2. Requirements Analysis
3. SDLC Routing
4. Architecture Design
5. Code Implementation
6. Testing & Validation
7. Documentation Generation
8. Internal Review
9. Branch & PR Management
10. Deployment & Maintenance
11. Specialized Agents (Security, Performance, Integration, DevOps)
