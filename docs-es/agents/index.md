# SAGE Agents â€” Overview

The **SlackDevs Agentic Governance Engine (SAGE)** consists of specialized AI agents, each responsible for specific aspects of the software development lifecycle (Human Governed AI Development Playbook). These agents collaborate autonomously to deliver high-quality software while maintaining human oversight at critical decision points.

## Universal Agent Architecture

SAGE agents are designed to be:

- **Technology Agnostic**: Work with any programming language, framework, or platform
- **Scalable**: Adapt from solo projects to enterprise-scale developments  
- **Governance-Driven**: Operate under configurable human oversight and approval matrices
- **Quality-Focused**: Implement comprehensive quality gates and validation mechanisms
- **Security-First**: Integrate security best practices throughout the development lifecycle
